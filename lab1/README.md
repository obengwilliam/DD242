Assignment 1 
 - Train and test a one layer network with multiple outputs 
 - to classify images from CIFAR-10 dataset 
 - train the network using mini-batch gradient applied to a cost function 
 - the cost function computes the cross-entropy loss of the classifier applied to the labelled training data 
 - and then add an L2 regularization term on the weight matrix
